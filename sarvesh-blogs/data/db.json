The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), the standards organization behind the tech that lets you wirelessly connect a pair of headphones, quietly announced an update to the specification this week. When it arrives, Bluetooth 6 will improve streaming between devices, and it vows to help find other Bluetooth devices within proximity faster by introducing a feature called Channel Sounding. This is the first significant update to the spec since Bluetooth 5 launched in 2016.\n\nChannel Sounding adds “true distance awareness” for Bluetooth devices to better track things like AirTags down to the centimeter. The feature promises to improve the overall user experience of tracking down devices, making it “significantly easier and quicker” to locate lost items connected through a “Find My” network. It seems the ability was prioritized to comply with what Bluetooth calls the “‘Find My’ Phenomenon,” indicating this might be an Apple-compliant feature from the get-go. Plenty of blogs have rolled with it and declare that this is how we’ll locate AirTags soon. There’s little discourse around the Find My Device network for Android users. \n\nIf there’s one thing I viscerally remember from attempting to play Ecco the Dolphin 2: The Tides of Time, it’s that first level with the crystal-looking “glyphs” where you’re supposed to echolocate the heck out of it to get them to budge. That is what I imagine Bluetooth 6 will be like when it hits the market, pinging around for any devices emitting a specific type of connectivity—except it won’t require help from the neighbor’s kid to get past that particular level.\n\nBluetooth 6.0 boasts that adding Channel Sounding will improve keyless entry between the phone and the cars enabled. The feature will allow developers to “enhance the security” of the digital key with an extra layer that only unlocks a vehicle when connected with an authorized device at a particular distance.\n\nAs for Bluetooth peripherals like keyboards and game controllers, you can expect them to better switch between active and inactive states based on distance. That means when you walk away from your desk with a mouse and keyboard still connected, the devices aren’t pressing stray buttons or sucking down leftover battery power as they attempt to find a device to communicate with. \n\nBluetooth has yet to announce improved lossless audio streaming between devices. This particular version seems focused on improving the experience for connected devices rather than the experience of streaming. There are no devices announced with Bluetooth 6 quite yet. ",
